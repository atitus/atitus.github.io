title: First github blog in jekyll
---

I'm trying Github as my primary web site to post code, teaching ideas, and other commentary. I like the idea of writing with Markdown, and I like the idea of a simply static web-site generator (Jekyll).

After many attempts at creating a logo, I finally used a screenshot of a VPython program for a student programming exercise in my class where they launch a spacecraft from a stationary Earth to a stationary Moon. This particular path is interesting.

My goal in 2017 is to write one blog post per week.
