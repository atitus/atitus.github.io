I teach all levels of physics at High Point University. This includes general education science classes, introductory physics, and advanced physics. I have a BS in physics from Penn State University and a Ph.D. in physics from North Carolina State University. My dissertation was in physics education under the direction of Bob Beichner.

My professional interest is physics education, especially effective applications of educational technology. I codeveloped WebAssign with Dr. Larry Martin as a graduate student. I have worked with (and been influenced by) John Risley, Bob Beichner, Larry Martin, Wolfgang Christian, Mario Belloni, Francisco Esquembre, Ruth Chabay, and Bruce Sherwood.

I use [Matter & Interactions](http://matterandinteractions.org/), an innovative calculus-based textbook by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood, and I am involved in the community of M&I users.

I currently collaborate most closely with Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood on *Matter & Interactions* and VPython.
